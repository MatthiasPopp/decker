# Notes

## Currently

-   Content marked `.notes` serves two purposes
-   Reveal.js uses it as *speaker notes*
-   It augments slide content in handouts

## In the future

-   Content marked `.notes` is used only as *speaker notes*
-   Content marked `.handout` is only shown in handout documents
-   Content marked `.deck` is only shown in slide decks
-   Untagged content is shown in decks and handouts
