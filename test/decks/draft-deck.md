# Non-draft Deck

This should be the only non-draft deck if `draft: true` is set in `decker.yaml`.

# Solution Slides

Slides marked with class `solution` are culled from the deck if the deck is declared to be upcoming with `lecture.status: upcoming` in the meta data.

This deck:

- `lecture.status:` [:meta](lecture.status)

If `lecture.status:` is `upcoming` the next slide should be missing 

# Missing {.solution}
