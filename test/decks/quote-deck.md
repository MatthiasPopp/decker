> "Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western
> spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at
> a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant
> little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly
> primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea."

## One more {.right}

> what really is going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is to
> say hang the sense of it and just keep yourself occupied."
