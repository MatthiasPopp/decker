# Meta Data

Meta data variables are specified in YAML format and can be defined in
four different places. In order of increasing precedence these are:

-   the optional `decker.yaml` file that is read from the project's root
    directory
-   the `-m key=value` option on the `decker` command line (NOT YET
    IMPLEMENTED)
-   additional meta data files specified in the meta data variable
    `meta-data`
-   the meta data sections of the slide source Markdown file

Meta data is hierarchical but most variables are defined at the top
level. A notable exception are variables that are used to set *local
path* values (see [Local paths](#local-paths)) in the slide template
(see [Variables for Reveal.js](#variables-revealjs)). These path values
are located in the `template` namespace. For example, the value for the
optional title teaser image is provided in the variable
`template.title-teaser`.

Inside a YAML file or a YAML section of a file hierarchical meta
variable values are defined as follows:

``` {.yaml}
template:
    title-teaser: /images/teaser.png
```

On the command line this can be specified as

``` {.sh}
decker -m 'template.title-teaser=/images/teaser.pn'
```

## Local paths {#local-paths}

Paths to local file resources that are referenced by slide sets need to
be provided in several contexts. For example

-   as a URL in an image tag to locate local media files like images or
    videos

    ``` {.markdown}
    ## A very important image

    ![](image.png)
    ```

-   as the value of meta data variable, for example to provide the
    location of the bibliography database and the citation style
    definition

    ``` {.yaml}
    bibliography: /bib/bibliography.tex
    csl: /bib/chicago-author-data.csl
    ```

In any case, path values for local file resources are interpreted either
as relative to the defining file, if specified as a *relative path*, or
as relative to the project root directory, if specified as an *absolute
path*.

Consider the following project layout and file contents

``` {.txt}
project
â”œâ”€â”€ images
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ image.png
â””â”€â”€ slides
 Â Â  â””â”€â”€ slide-deck.md
```

`slides/slide-deck.md`:

:   ``` {.markdown}
    # First slide
    ![Project relative path](/images/image.png)
    ![Document relative path](../images/image.png)
    ```

Both image paths reference the same image file.

## Variables for Reveal.js {#variables-revealjs}

Decker uses a modified version of the standard pandoc template for
reveal.js slide sets. Most if the variables used there are supported by
decker. Additionally, there are several Decker specific variables that
control various aspects of the generated slide sets.

`align-global`
:   default alignment for various slide elements (defaults to `left`)

`mario` ðŸš§
:   use Mario's CSS for the slides (defaults to `false`)

`template.base-css` ðŸš§
:   the first CSS file that is loaded by the template (defaults to `''`)

`template.css` ðŸš§
:   alist of CSS files that is loaded after the default CSS files
    (defaults to `[]`)

`template.title-header`
:   a header image for the title slide (defaults to `''`)

`template.title-teaser`
:   an image that is placed below the title line on the title slide
    (defaults to `''`)

`template.affiliation-logo`
:   an imge that is placed above the affiliation information on the
    title slide (defaults to `''`)

`template.include-js` ðŸš§
:   a list of Javascript files that are included into the slide deck
    before Reveal.js is initialized (defaults to `[]`)

`style` ðŸš§

:   a list of CSS styles that are inserted into the HTML header
    (defaults to `[]`)

    For example, to set the background color of a all H2 header elements
    to red specify:

    ``` {.yaml}
    style:
      - 'h2 { backgroundColor: #f00; }' 
    ```

`thebelab.enable` ðŸš§
:   enable ThebeLab for the deck (defaults to `false`, see
    [ThebeLab](#thebelab))

`checkOverflow`
:   mark overrflowing slides with a red border (defaults to `false`)

`vertical-slides`
:   allow vertical slides (defaults to `false`)
